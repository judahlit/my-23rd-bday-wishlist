# **My Wishlist**

## **Pyjamas**

My current pyjamas are tearing. I need new ones.

### Basic Criteria

I would like pyjamas with the following criteria:

- Is size M.
  - If the pants and shirt are being bought separately, then:
    - Shirt: M
    - Pants: 30/32
- The color is black, or another dark colour such as dark blue.
- Has long sleeves.

### Material Criteria

They should also be soft and good quality. Materials matter, and unfortunately buying a good pyjama like this isn't cheap. I did a bit of research with Gemini and Claude AI, and have verified that the findings are accurate. Here they are:

---

#### **Primary Choice: Modal or Cotton-Modal Blend**

- **Material:** 95% Modal + 5% Spandex OR 70% Cotton + 30% Modal
- **Price:** €35-60
- **Why:** Best balance of softness (almost like silk), durability (3-5 years), value, and easy care
- **European brands:** Schiesser, Calida (may have modal options)

#### **Premium Choice: Tencel/Lyocell**

- **Material:** 100% Tencel or Tencel-Cotton blend
- **Price:** €60-90
- **Why:** Superior moisture-wicking, most durable cellulose fiber, best for hot sleepers
- **Slightly more expensive but lasts 5-10 years**

#### **Budget Choice: 100% Cotton (Egyptian or Pima)**

- **Material:** 100% Long-staple cotton
- **Price:** €35-50
- **Why:** Classic, durable, easy care, widely available
- **European brands:** Schiesser, Paul Hopkins

#### **MATERIALS TO AVOID FOR YOUR NEEDS:**

- :x: **Silk** - Too expensive (€100+), high maintenance
- :x: **Cashmere** - Too expensive (€150+), too warm for year-round
- :x: **Viscose/Rayon** - Too fragile, short lifespan (1-2 years)
- :x: **Pure Bamboo Viscose** - Less durable than modal/tencel, chemical concerns
- :x: **Fleece** - Not breathable, too warm, not suitable for pajamas unless winter-only
- :x: **Polyester** - Not breathable, traps heat and moisture, can feel clammy, irritates sensitive skin, retains odors, not recommended for sleepwear (synthetic feel, no temperature regulation)

#### **Bottom Line:**

For a **high-quality, soft, durable, reasonably-priced** black long-sleeve PJ set with **European fit**, your best bet is:

##### 🏆 **Modal or Cotton-Modal Blend (€40-60)**  

##### 🥈 **Tencel/Lyocell (€60-90)** if you can stretch the budget  

##### 🥉 **100% Egyptian/Pima Cotton (€35-50)** if you want classic and affordable

If it were me buying my pyjamas, I would likely buy [this one](https://chelseapeers.com/en-eu/products/tencel-modal-long-crew-neck-pyjama-set-navy), even though I would agonize over the price. I just couldn't find something of better value. I also like that the design is simplistic, and has a round neck opening.

## **Pull-Up Bar**

I want a wall-mounted pull-up bar above my door on the inside of my large room. It should have these criteria:

- Can handle at least up to 150 kg (for certain stability).
- Has various padded grip locations (or is padded for the entire bar).
- Extends forward for 20-30 cm.
  - Not more than 30cm, otherwise it will look ugly.
  - Not less than 20cm, otherwise I will be colliding with the door and wall when doing pull-ups. 20cm may actually be slightly too close already.
- Has good reviews online.

If no bar could be found with these criteria, I'd like something like [this](https://www.amazon.nl/-/en/mounting-spreader-multifunctional-non-slip-punching/dp/B0DMPQTG7M) installed next to my closet in my sleeping room. This extends too much for my liking for my large room. It also bothers me that it doesn't look simple and minimalistic.

## **Tea Pot with Fine Filter**

Fresh tea leaves are healthier and taste better. I believe they can be bought for a cheap price at the Turkish store in Eindhoven. To more easily drink this kind of tea, I think it would be nice to buy a teapot like [this one](https://www.amazon.nl/-/en/STNTUS-Glass-Infuser-Stainless-Strainer/dp/B0869DL2PM/262-2208088-9905938). It has the following features:

1. It has a kind of glass that doesn't break from thermal shock.
2. It has a fine filter.
3. It is designed to prevent spillage.

It doesn't have to be this specific tea pot, but I thought this was a nice candidate. It doesn't insulate heat, but most teapots like this do not insulate tea well. The ones that claim to do so can only confidently say that the tea within them stays warm for only 1 hour.

My idea was to just put tea from a teapot like this into my own thermal bottle, but mom and Jacco thought it would be nice to buy a certain type of cloth that keeps the tea warm. Sounds good.

## **Gym Resistance Bands**

I want [this one](https://www.amazon.nl/-/en/Flintronic-Resistance-Different-Exercise-Strengthening/dp/B0D87MNHY2). This one would be the easiest for me to buy myself.
